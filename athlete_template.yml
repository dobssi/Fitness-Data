# Basic profile
athlete:
  name: "Athlete Name"        # Your name (shown on dashboard)
  mass_kg: 70.0               # Body mass in kg (constant, not daily weight)
  date_of_birth: "1990-01-01" # YYYY-MM-DD format
  gender: "male"              # "male" or "female" (for age grading tables)
  timezone: "Europe/London"   # Your timezone (for date display)

  # HR thresholds (for zone calculations)
  # If you don't know these, leave them and the pipeline will estimate from your data.
  # max_hr: look at your hardest race or interval session for the highest HR recorded.
  # lthr: roughly 93% of max_hr if unsure.
  lthr: 165                   # Lactate Threshold Heart Rate
  max_hr: 185                 # Maximum Heart Rate

# Planned races (optional — for dashboard race readiness section)
# Priority: A = goal race, B = important, C = training race
# Surface: road, trail, undulating_trail, track, indoor_track
planned_races: []
  # Example:
  # - name: "Spring Half Marathon"
  #   date: "2026-05-01"
  #   distance_km: 21.097
  #   priority: A
  #   surface: road

# Power mode — GAP uses pace + heart rate, no power meter needed
